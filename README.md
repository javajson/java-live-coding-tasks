# Java Live Coding Task

AList class is similar to a ArrayList from Java and works the same.
Currently the class is not implemented but you have a unit test for it.

You task is to implements some methods and make few test cases green.
It would be great if you use TDD cycle during development.

Here is no any catches and everything is clear, fair and familiar.
If you coded enough time then you'll for sure can make at least one test case happy.
It's not even matter how many test cases are solved, just some task to help you and interviwer to a feel and understand each other in somewhat reall work.
